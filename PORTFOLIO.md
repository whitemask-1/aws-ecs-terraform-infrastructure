# DevOps Portfolio - AWS Infrastructure Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to design, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. It showcases practical DevOps skills including containerization, cloud architecture, and automated deployment.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as Code
- **AWS ECS Fargate** - Serverless container orchestration
- **AWS CloudWatch** - Monitoring and logging
- **AWS VPC/Security Groups** - Network security
- **AWS IAM** - Access management
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Nginx** - Web server
